# Find My Brewery-Project 1 üçª

## Description

We have worked together to develop a web page to help tourists and locals find their way to the nearest brewery in the city of their choice in Georgia. This page is easily accessible and interactive. It displays color images of breweries when you search them along with their information, including address and operating hours. The page also features a weather display for the city you are searching for. When you click on the 'Enter' button, you will be prompted to submit your date of birth for age verification. Since this is a page involving alcoholic beverages, you must be 18 years or older to be able to access it. Once, inside you will be prompted to search for the city of your choice and when you click search, then you will be presented with the breweries available to you along with the weather to help you plan your day.üçª

## Purpose

We developed this page to provide an alternative to those searching to quest their thirst with a nice brew and are looking to do so in the ambiance of the brewery rather than a crowded bar. It simple to use and easy to read, easily leading and providing the user with the alternatives at hand for them to choose from. In time this page can expand and grow it's ability to search any city you are visiting in the world.

## User Story

SO THAT I can enjoy the brewery üçª without spending hours looking around.
